Build
--------------------------------------------------------------------
To build the source code cmake v2.8 is needed and Boost Libraries V1.42
are necessary.  Cmake can be downloaded from: http://www.cmake.org/
Boost Libraries can be downloaded from: http://www.boost.org/
The proper way to create the project files/make files is out of source
with cmake.  IE Vorilon/build
then compile under the build directory or load up your favorite coding
software and make changes.
