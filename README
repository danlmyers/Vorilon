Vorilon is a voice communication system, this is the server component.
Or a distributed communication system that will handle a variety of
information including voice, text, video (at some point in time).


Libraries
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Vorilon requires the use of several libraries and build tools.
Cmake v2.8: http://www.cmake.org/
Boost Libraries v1.42: http://www.boost.org/

Build
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The proper way to build is an out of source build.  IE. /vorilon/build/
using cmake, if the libraries are not in the default installation path
they will have to be manually found and added.  Using static libraries
unless otherwise specified.
